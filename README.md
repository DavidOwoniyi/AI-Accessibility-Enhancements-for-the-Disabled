# Sign Language Recognition and Conversion

This project provides a tool that recognizes and converts sign language gestures into text and speech using AI models and machine learning techniques. It is designed to assist individuals with disabilities in communication, offering a simple and effective way to translate static, single-handed sign language gestures into spoken words.

## Features

- **Sign Language Recognition**: Detects and interprets static, single-handed sign language gestures.
- **Text Conversion**: Converts recognized gestures into corresponding text.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Uses Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) to convert the text into speech.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Displays the captured video feed with visual markers indicating recognized gestures.

## Why It’s Different

Unlike other sign language recognition systems that may require complex gestures involving two hands or dynamic movements, this tool focuses solely on recognizing stationary, single-handed gestures. This simplifies the recognition process and makes the tool accessible to a broader audience, especially those who rely on more straightforward sign language.

## How to Use

1. **Capture Gestures**: The tool captures images of sign language gestures using a webcam and stores them for model training.
2. **Train the Model**: The captured images are processed to train a Random Forest classifier that recognizes different gestures.
3. **Run the Program**: The trained model is used to detect gestures in real-time, convert them to text, and then to speech.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Data Collection**:
    - Run the data collection script to capture images for each gesture.
    - Press 'r' to start capturing images for a gesture and 'x' to exit.

2. **Model Training**:
    - After collecting sufficient data, run the training script to build a classifier model.
    - The trained model will be saved to a file for future use.

3. **Gesture Recognition**:
    - Run the gesture recognition script to start detecting gestures in real-time.
    - The program will display the recognized gesture on the screen and convert it to speech.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Dependencies

Install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should include:
```plaintext
opencv-python
mediapipe
scikit-learn
gtts
playsound
```

### Running the Program

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-recognition.git
    cd sign-language-recognition
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the scripts in the following order:
    - `data_collection.py` to collect training data.
    - `train_model.py` to train the model.
    - `gesture_recognition.py` to recognize gestures in real-time.

### Compiling from Source

If you need to compile the project from source, ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. Use the following steps:

1. Set up a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe scikit-learn gtts playsound
    ```

3. Run the Python scripts directly as described in the "Running the Program" section.

## Limitations

- **Single-Handed Gestures**: This tool only supports static gestures made with one hand. It does not recognize gestures that involve two hands or require hand movement.
- **Static Gestures Only**: Dynamic sign language gestures or those requiring movement are not supported.
- **Limited Gesture Set**: The current implementation is limited to the predefined gestures for letters, numbers, and a few symbols.
